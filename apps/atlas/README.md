## Supported Formats

Decoding depends on what the **browser** supports — the container is just the wrapper, the codec inside is what matters.

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Import (Decode)</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>Video files</b></td><td>MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI, MKV, WMV, M4V, FLV</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Video codecs</b></td><td>H.264 (AVC), H.265 (HEVC)¹, VP8, VP9, AV1</td></tr>

<tr><th colspan="2">Export (Encode)</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>Video containers</b></td><td>MP4, WebM via WebCodecs / HTMLVideo; MOV, MKV, AVI, MXF via FFmpeg WASM</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>FFmpeg codecs</b></td><td>ProRes, DNxHR, FFV1, UTVideo, MJPEG</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Video codecs</b></td><td>H.264, H.265¹, VP9, AV1 — GPU-accelerated via WebCodecs</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Image export</b></td><td>PNG, JPG/JPEG, WebP, BMP (current playhead frame)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Audio-only export</b></td><td>WAV, plus AAC or OGG/Opus depending on browser codec support</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Interchange</b></td><td>FCPXML (Final Cut Pro / DaVinci Resolve)</td></tr>
</table>

¹ H.265 decode/encode depends on OS & hardware — full support on Windows, partial on macOS/Linux.

> **MOV** files work because they share the same ISO BMFF container as MP4 — any MOV with H.264/H.265 inside plays fine. **MKV** works if it contains browser-decodable codecs (H.264, VP9, etc.). Native Helper decode is an opt-in companion path for browser gaps when the helper is connected and the source path is resolvable; unsupported codecs do not automatically switch to it.

## What Makes This Different

Most browser-based video editors share a pattern: Canvas 2D compositing, heavyweight dependency trees, and CPU-bound rendering that falls apart at scale. This project takes a fundamentally different approach.

**GPU-first architecture.** Preview, scrubbing, and export all run through the same **WebGPU ping-pong compositor**. Video textures are imported as `texture_external` (**zero-copy**, no CPU roundtrip). **37 blend modes**, 3D rotation, and inline color effects all execute in a **single WGSL composite shader** per layer. The 3D layer system now renders through the native WebGPU shared-scene path for 3D planes, primitive meshes, 3D text, OBJ/glTF/GLB models, camera clips, and gaussian splats - no GSAP, no Canvas 2D fallback in the hot path.

**Current startup footprint.** A fresh production build loads an editor shell of about **2 MB compressed** on the main editor start path. The largest contributors are the native 3D / gaussian-splat render path, browser-side media parsing/runtime code, and AI/media helper modules.

**Zero-copy export pipeline.** Frames are captured as `new VideoFrame(offscreenCanvas)` directly from the GPU canvas. **No `readPixels()`**, no `getImageData()`, no staging buffers in the default path. The GPU renders, **WebCodecs encodes**. That's it.

**3-tier scrubbing cache.** **300 GPU textures in VRAM** for instant scrub (Tier 1), per-video last-frame cache for seek transitions (Tier 2), and a **900-frame RAM Preview** with CPU/GPU promotion (Tier 3). When the cache is warm, **scrubbing doesn't decode at all**.

**Audio workstation in the timeline.** Audio Focus turns the timeline into a detailed waveform and spectrogram editor with non-destructive region edits, gain fades, silence removal, repair operations, spectral selections, image-in-spectrum layers, recording, and bake/unbake. The docked Audio Mixer adds track/master strips, Peak/RMS meters, stereo phase correlation, track sends rendered into the master return mix, FX stacks, limiter controls, and export preflight. Stem separation runs a browser ONNX Demucs/HTDemucs path and publishes Vocals, Drums, Bass, and Other stems as normal WAV media when the project media write succeeds, with artifact-backed fallback state when it cannot.

**20 direct runtime dependencies.** React/React DOM, Zustand, MediaBunny and its MP3 encoder, mp4box, PlayCanvas / splat-transform helpers, dotLottie, Rive WASM, HuggingFace Transformers, ONNX Runtime, SoundTouch, FFmpeg WASM packages, fflate, gifenc, Tabler icons, and WebGPU types. **Everything else is custom-built from scratch**: the WebGPU compositor, all 34 GPU effects, the 23-effect audio registry, the keyframe animation system, the export engine, the audio mixer, the text renderer, the mask engine, the video scope renderers, the dock/panel system, the timeline UI, and the native shared 3D scene path. Zero runtime abstraction layers between your timeline and the GPU.

**Nested composition rendering.** Compositions within compositions, each with their own resolution. The normal 2D/nested compositor path renders them to **pooled GPU textures** with frame-level caching and composites them in the parent's ping-pong pass. Native 3D and gaussian-splat auxiliary paths can submit their own GPU work when those layer types are active.

**On-device AI and analysis.** SAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2) runs entirely in-browser via ONNX Runtime. Click to select objects in the preview, propagate masks across frames. Stem separation writes project-local WAV media, while local transcription, waveform pyramids, spectrogram tiles, loudness envelopes, beat/onset maps, and frequency/phase summaries are generated as project artifacts instead of being baked into timeline clips. Large neural models are loaded on demand.

## Why I Built This

No Adobe subscription, no patience for cracks, and no template-first online editor. MasterSelects is fast in the browser, GPU-first, built for real editing, and open enough that AI can steer the timeline instead of just suggesting ideas.

**The vision:** an editor where AI can directly operate the tool. The built-in chat exposes editor operations across timeline, media, editing, playback, stats, and node-workspace actions. Developers can connect a self-hosted external agent through the token-authenticated local MCP/dev bridge. Multi-output routing is built in.

~330k lines of TypeScript/TSX app code, ~4.1k lines of WGSL shader files, and a Rust native helper cover the browser gaps that still matter.

---

## AI Control

MasterSelects centers on the idea that AI should be able to *do the edit*, not just talk about it.

- **Built-in editor chat:** Hosted agent/kernel execution with a fixed application prompt and the reviewed editor-operation surface
- **External agents in development:** Claude Code, Codex, or another self-hosted agent can use `npm run mcp`; the local MCP server owns no model, provider key, or billing relationship
- **AI video, image, and audio generation:** FlashBoard uses hosted generation routes; provider credentials never enter browser settings or project files
- **Multicam and analysis:** Audio-based sync, manual multicam alignment, and transcript-based sync when transcripts are available
- **On-device AI:** SAM2 segmentation in-browser via ONNX Runtime, MatAnyone2 via Native Helper, plus local Whisper transcription via Transformers.js

Run the development-only MCP adapter while the Vite app is open:

```bash
npm run mcp
```

This adapter talks only to the token-authenticated local development bridge. MasterSelects does not ship a production agent harness; users who want another model or agent host it themselves.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173
```

**Requirements:** Chrome or Edge with WebGPU support. A dedicated GPU is recommended.

> **Firefox:** project storage requires the Native Helper backend because Firefox does not support the File System Access API flow used by Chrome.

> **Linux:** Enable Vulkan for smooth 60fps: `chrome://flags/#enable-vulkan`

---

## Native Helper

Cross-platform Rust companion app for the parts browsers still can't do well. Required for Firefox project storage and for yt-dlp-based downloads.

```bash
cd tools/native-helper
cargo run --release    # WebSocket :9876, HTTP :9877
```

| Capability | Details |
|---|---|
| **Storage** | Native project persistence backend for Firefox |
| **Local AI** | MatAnyone2 video matting and MuScriptor transcription sidecars |
| **Download** | yt-dlp integration for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter/X, Vimeo, and other supported sites |

**Platforms:** Windows, Linux, macOS. Building the Native Helper requires Rust. The Windows MSI bundles `yt-dlp.exe`; source builds and non-Windows archive installs use `yt-dlp` from the helper folder or PATH. See [Native Helper docs](tools/native-helper/README.md) for platform-specific setup.

---

## Security

MasterSelects is a **local-first editor**. Editing, rendering, caching, and most analysis stay in the browser unless you explicitly invoke an external provider or the Native Helper.

- **Provider credentials:** hosted AI credentials stay server-side; the optional YouTube integration key is encrypted in browser IndexedDB
- **Native Helper:** binds to `127.0.0.1` only, requires a random startup Bearer token for HTTP and WebSocket
- **Dev bridge:** Vite `/api/ai-tools` and local file routes require a per-session token and reject non-loopback origins
- **Local file access:** restricted to explicit allowed roots (project root, temp, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Videos)
- **AI tool policy:** external bridge calls run through caller restrictions and approval gates
- **Secret handling:** logs redact common secret/token patterns; AI provider keys are not accepted from browser settings or project files
- **CI checks:** secret scanning, JS and Rust security audits, dedicated tests for bridge auth and file access policy

**Known boundary:** this is not perfect sandboxing. Same-user local processes, malicious browser extensions, and compromised same-origin code can still be dangerous. The goal is **clear, test-covered local trust boundaries**.

See [Security.md](docs/Features/Security.md) for the full trust model and limitations.

## Known Issues

This is alpha software. Features get added fast, things break.

- FFmpeg WASM export is blocking and constrained by browser memory
- Stem separation downloads a large ONNX model on first use and depends on WebGPU/WASM runtime performance
- Firefox project storage requires the Native Helper backend
- Video downloads require Native Helper; the Windows MSI bundles yt-dlp, while source/non-Windows installs need yt-dlp beside the helper or on PATH
- Audio waveforms may not display for some video formats
- Very long videos (>2 hours) may cause performance issues

If something breaks, refresh. If it's still broken, [open an issue](https://github.com/Sportinger/MasterSelects/issues).
