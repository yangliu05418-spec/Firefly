// Shared MIDI synth interface (issue #193).
//
// The one seam every note producer routes through, so the live scheduler, piano-
// roll preview, and offline export renderer can swap synth implementations
// (simple oscillator vs General MIDI wavetable) per MIDI track without any of them
// knowing which concrete synth they hold. `MidiSynth` (oscillator) and the future
// `WavetableSynth` (GM samples) both implement this; `createSynthForInstrument`
// picks the right one from a track's instrument.
